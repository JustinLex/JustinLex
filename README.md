### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Justin Lex-HammarskjÃ¶ld, a computer nerd and an open-source and self-hosting evangelist.

This is my Github account for work and other open-source projects.

I'm in the process of migrating all of the active projects I own to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/jlh), an open-source alternative to Github.

At my day job, I work as a DevOps engineer for Unraid, where I'm working with an amazing team to build world-class digital infrastructure. 
Note that all code hosted here and any opinions I express are my own, not the views of Unraid/Lime Technology Inc.
